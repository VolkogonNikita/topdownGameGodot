## 📝 About the project

I'm developing a **topdown game** using the Godot Engine 4.4.1 for my graduation project. Next, I will present the initial result that Mikhail helped me with, and in particular his course. This result is my starting point. 

The game will be **redesigned and improved**:
- 🎨 **Visual appearance** — new graphics, animations, and effects
- ⚙️ **Game mechanics** — enhanced gameplay systems
- 🧠 **AI models** — intelligent enemies and NPCs

The video of the finished game will be posted after the project is fully completed and tested.
